### Architecture

Django is designed to be used on a client-server architecture. Describe how changes to the server architecture would need to be carefully validated to make sure that all functional and non-functional elements are intact.

The front-end architecture is likely to remain as a web browser. However, the use of the browser might show differences if used on desktop vs. mobile architectures.

Explain how the use of the Bootstrap library helps to make sure that is user experience is consistent, or as expected.

### Platform

This relates closely to the above. Describe the need to test after platform updates.

### Programming language

New versions of the language are introduced periodically. It is unlikely that they will be ‘breaking changes,’ where the original application no longer works. Explain why this is important to the owners of the language, and its user base.

Sometimes, the changes will offer new features that allow the application to be improved in terms of efficiency. There may even be cases where it allows functionality that was not previously possible.

Explain that this may offer the developer opportunities to extend their business relationship with the client.

Include a brief discussion of why it is important for the developer not to let the client see these changes as a zero-cost expectation.
