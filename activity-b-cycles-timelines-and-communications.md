# Activity B - Cycles, timelines, and Communications

### Life cycle

Consider the options for using different life cycle models, such as Waterfall, RAD, and Agile.&#x20;

The development of a Django application demands a phased approach that can be described in the terms outlined for an Agile development cycle. Explain how each of the components developed and integrated will use the Agile cycle model for planning, development, and testing.

Name the cycles precisely.

### Gantt Chart

</div>

Create a ‘simple’ Gantt chart showing all the jobs that must be done, illustrating how dependencies exist. For example, how a template needs to have a view and a URL developed to be shown in the browser.

It might be useful to show how the use of a ‘master’ html file that uses Bootstrap would be created before the templates/pages are developed.

### Collaborative techniques for feedback and response.

Describe how you will collaborate with the client and the end-users who will test the application. The deployed application will be used to gather feedback to ‘inform future development.’ Describe how that will be done during Task 3A.
