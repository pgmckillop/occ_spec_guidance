Explain that Task 1 is based mostly on Empathise - Define - and Ideate. The strategy for testing will be defined.

The document will consider different user types and Persona and Empathy maps will be produced for each type. These will be generated in graphical and textual formats.

This will allow brief, clear problem statements to be written, and these will be the basis of the Ideation processes.

Task 2 will focus on the Prototype and testing process.
