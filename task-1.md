# Task 1

## Analysing the problem and designing a solution

The task has the highest available marks of any in the project. The total available marks is 58.

You are given 20 hours of supervised task time to complete the tasks. This will be split into separate sessions. In each session, you will have to work without any support material, other than any research data you may have gathered.

You will build the evidence 'progressively' as you carry out the tasks, and this document is intended to give you a structure for a comprehensive design document.

The task set is divided into two main parts:

* Activity A Research and Proposal \[24 Marks]
* Activity B Design Documentation \[34 Marks]
