### Standardisation

Explain that taking a standardised approach to design will make sure that all members of a development team will be producing the same type of code using the same frameworks available. A clear definition of the standardised language style that will be used will improve understanding between different people working on the project. It would also allow reviews of the project's progress to check that the required outcome is being produced.

### Layout

It is important that the layout is designed to meet the needs of the client and the end users. The developer may have to consider the types of devices that are being used to run the application as a finished product including the capacity for these devices in terms of processing power. The client may wish to include design elements that are included beyond those needed for the functional requirements.

### Control position and UX

It is important that navigation and action controls will be found by users in an expected position That is used throughout all controls implemented into the application. They should not have to look for these controls when trying to use the software.

### Colour schemes

Django includes some built-in colour schemes that are applied by default.

The client will likely ask the developer to use particular colours that represent their organisation’s branding. Where possible the developer should secure accurate definitions of these colours through schemes such as RGB definitions.

### Responsiveness

Django includes some capacity to be responsive especially where the Bootstrap library is integrated into the application. The developer must be aware of the effect of the change in interface space on the layouts and use of the application’s features.

### Assets

Django allows the use of assets, allowing them to be used statically or dynamically. The files must be stored in specifically named folders so that they can be used in the application. The locations of the media files are coordinated using the settings file built into the admin of the framework.

### Intellectual Property

When a developer is asked to use a file or set of files, they must make sure that the ownership of these files allows them to be used without constraints in the software development being undertaken. The developer must secure this assurance in writing from the source where the media files are derived from.

### Licensing

The developer must make sure that any media files used can be integrated without the payment of additional licensing fees as this can be hard to control and may lead to legal action in the future if any breach of copyright happens.

### Bespoke design

The developer may have skills in the design of assets and could use these to create custom, bespoke media files for the application. However, this could be complex and add to the processes needed to get client approval.

### Value of developer time

The developer must be clear about how much time is needed to complete each phase of the application and this should be defined very clearly in the planning process so that any deadlines that have been set by the client can be met without delays. Many developers are required to work on multiple projects at the same time and this can make planning difficult as one delay can lead to others. When developers meet a delay, they must make sure that the client is informed as soon as possible.

### Availability of required skills

On some occasions, a developer may not have all of the skills required to complete the whole of the complexity of the application. For example, they may have significant programming skills but are not sufficiently capable to implement the database. In such cases they may employ a freelance developer to fill the gaps, making sure that delays are reduced.
