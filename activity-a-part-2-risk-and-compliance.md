### Risk identification and mitigation

Risk only exists if a system has a vulnerability that can be exploited by a threat. It is often expressed as a score representing the likelihood that the system will be affected by the threat.

Potentially, risk will exist at every stage of the development lifecycle.

It is important to identify potential threats to the development, deployment, and use of the software. The identification allows the developer and client to assess the risk of the threats having an impact, and then take measures to mitigate those risks.

Risk should be identified and assessed in a Risk Register. Mitigation should be identified to reduce the likelihood of the event and/or to reduce its effect on the project. (See sample register format in Appendix A)

You should discuss how all stakeholders can help a team identify the threats and mitigate the risks.

The whole lifecycle could offer chances for discussion:

### Compliance with legislation, regulations, and guidelines.

You should provide a generalised explanation of how the law affects software development responsibilities. The laws around data, and the misuse of computers, will always apply. Additionally, your research relating to the scenario in the first task may reveal specific regulations and guidelines affecting that area.

Do not forget the responsibilities outlined by the British Computer Society, and how they promote professional standards of behaviour in software development.
