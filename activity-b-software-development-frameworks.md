## Overview of frameworks

Describe what a framework is and why one would use it

Software development frameworks, such as Django for Python, Laravel for PHP, and Ruby on Rails for Ruby, provide a structured foundation for building applications efficiently and effectively. These frameworks offer pre-written code and libraries, simplifying the development process and reducing the time required to build complex functionalities from scratch. They promote best practices in coding and design, enhancing code readability and maintainability, which is especially beneficial for team collaborations and large projects.&#x20;

Frameworks often include built-in components for handling common tasks like database interaction, session management, and user authentication, allowing developers to focus on unique aspects of their applications. Moreover, most frameworks follow the principle of 'convention over configuration', which minimizes the need for extensive setup and configuration, streamlining the development workflow.&#x20;

The use of frameworks also aids in ensuring application security by providing tools and features that help protect against common vulnerabilities.&#x20;

Additionally, they are supported by active communities that contribute to a wealth of resources, documentation, and support, facilitating the resolution of issues and continuous learning‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã.
