### Family of languages

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used in programming and managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS).

### Syntactical overview

SQL syntax is declarative, focusing on the “what” rather than the “how” of data manipulation. It uses statements like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.

### Advantages

* Allows for efficient querying and manipulation of large datasets.
* Widely used and supported by many database systems.
* Relatively easy to understand and use for managing databases.

### Disadvantages

* Limited to database management; not a general-purpose language.
* Complex queries can become difficult to write and understand.
* Scalability can be an issue with very large databases or complex operations.

### Analysis of current skill

Describe that your current level is basic, covering only the nature of the language and the syntax of simple CRUD scripts as required for this project.

### Own development requirements for SQL

Explain how the development of SQL could be useful in a variety of jobs, and its increasing importance as more data access systems are needed. Acknowledge that skills in NoSQL database systems is also especially important, as more use of mobile systems is a trend. Explain why a NoSQL database system can offer advantages to a system focused on mobile deployment.

### Immediate development requirements

Describe how you will continue to use Django to improve your SQL skills, even though they are hidden by the Django feature set.

### Future development requirements

Plan to develop the use of SQL without the support offered by Django. Consider the opportunity offered by training to use architectures such as .Net and SQL servers. Describe opportunities offered by skills in full-stack web architectures such as the Linux-Apache-MySql-PHP (LAMP). Explain that SQL skills are crucial to success in the use of them.

### External development resources

Courses offered by experts are freely available. Some are free, such as those on YouTube. Paid-for options include eLearning platforms such as Udemy, College and university courses, and commercial Bootcamps.
