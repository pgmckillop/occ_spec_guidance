# Activity A Part 1 RESEARCH

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Sector research.</strong></td><td>Explain why research is important to the successful development of software, especially in helping to understand the sector where it will be used.</td><td><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (123).png" alt="" data-size="original"></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Target markets.</strong></td><td><p>Describe the target market. Note that the word market does not have to mean that the sector is commercial, and that money must be paid.</p><p>Focus on who the software is for.</p></td><td><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (124).png" alt="" data-size="original"></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Growth patterns and longevity.</strong></td><td>Look for information on whether the sector is new and expanding or shrinking. Describe whether the sector has the potential to grow in the future.</td><td><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (125).png" alt="" data-size="original"></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Financial and funding models.</strong></td><td>Describe how the sector is funded. Mention all the sectors and select from Commercial, Government, Non-profit, Charitable, Educational. Investigate and describe the financial models used in the relevant sector.</td><td><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (129).png" alt="" data-size="original"></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Current use of software within the sector.</strong></td><td><p>Investigate the type of software that is used within the sector. Do people work in offices and at desks, or is the workforce mainly remote?</p><p>Will they be likely to use installed applications, or access software inline. How will they store the output of their work, for example, in the cloud?</p><p>Is the software they use commercial, open-source, or freeware?</p><p>What are the advantages and disadvantages?</p></td><td><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (126).png" alt="" data-size="original"></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Current use of hardware within the sector.</strong></td><td>Do the people use conventional PCs running Windows or Mac OS, or another system. Is mobile used on phone or tablet? What challenges might be set if a particular system is used? For example, limited screen sizes might affect interface design significantly.</td><td>What are the network requirements?<img src=".gitbook/assets/image (130).png" alt=""></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Newly emerging technologies.</strong></td><td>Are there significant changes coming into play, such as the introduction of IoT with sensor-based data gathering? Are new strategies for communication emerging?</td><td><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (128).png" alt="" data-size="original"></td></tr><tr><td><strong>New technology affecting the proposed solution.</strong></td><td>Will the solution be affected by the new technologies? For example, will the use of APIs be necessary, or will the software rely on access to the internet to operate? How can the effect of these constraints be mitigated?</td><td><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (131).png" alt="" data-size="original"></td></tr><tr><td><strong>New technology offering possibilities.</strong></td><td><p>Will changes offer advantages, such as reduced costs of hardware and software? Does it become easier to deploy new software and maintain existing installed applications?</p><p>Will it be easier to collaborate with the clients and/or the end users?</p></td><td><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (132).png" alt="" data-size="original"></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Different user types and their needs</strong></td><td>The range of users might be broad or limited and you must try to take account of the needs of each.</td><td><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (133).png" alt="" data-size="original"></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Range of skill or competence.</strong></td><td>Users are generally classified as basic, beginner, intermediate, competent, or expert. What effect might there be on the provision of support? Will the style of the UI be affected by this?</td><td><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (134).png" alt="" data-size="original"></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Legislation relating to the sector.</strong></td><td><p>Describe any legislation affecting the clients, developers, and users.</p><p>It is likely that legislation relating to data will apply. Think about legislation connected to intellectual property, security, and the working environment. Will characteristics described in the Equality Act be involved?</p><p>What’s the impact of all of these?</p></td><td><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (135).png" alt="" data-size="original"></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Regulations relating to the sector.</strong></td><td><p>Some sectors require people to observe regulations, such as people in the construction industry whose observance of Health and Safety, safe working practices, and so forth might affect their being allowed to carry out their work. A simple Google search of ‘regulations affecting in the UK might be helpful.</p><p><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (136).png" alt=""></p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Guidelines relating to the sector.</strong></td><td><p>Codes of practice may be in place to describe how people working in the sector should act. For example, you will certainly be able to describe how you, as a developer, would follow the guidelines set out by the British Computer Society. What’s the impact of that?</p><p>By observing guidelines, accreditation to ISO standards might be easier, for example.</p></td><td><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (137).png" alt="" data-size="original"></td></tr></tbody></table>
