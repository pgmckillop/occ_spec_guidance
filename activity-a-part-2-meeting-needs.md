### Meeting the needs of the Client

You must refer to the Set Task Brief to make sure that you explain how your proposal will fulfil all the functional and non-functional requirements expected of the prototype to be built. IT could be important to discuss that a prototype can be a good device for engineering change, where opportunities for improvement are identified.

### Meetings the needs of end-users

The end-userâ€™s User Experience will, of course, be dependent on the functional components working as required. However, the non-functional aspects will have a considerable influence on their opinion of the program. Care taken to involve the end-user in the design processes will be a sound investment in the program over time.

### Consider potential tension between the needs of the Client and those of the End-user

In many cases, there will be a mismatch between the needs of the client, and the end-user. Often, the client will have financial constraints that do not allow all the end-users desired features to be developed.

Also, the client may have a longer-term view than the end user. The client may see the proposed software as a building block for future development, or as part of a system yet to be implemented.
