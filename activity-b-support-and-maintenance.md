### User support

Describe why it is important to have considered how end-users will be helped to use the application, and how this is especially important when a completely new system is introduced. Go back to the section where you recognised that there will be several types of users, who might require various levels of support.

Describe that maintenance is need as circumstances change to keep the software operational.

### Functional/operational maintenance

The client may identify elements of the application’s functionality that need to be extended to add more aspects. They may also identify elements that are no longer needed.

Explain that the modularised structure of Django will help with these changes by reducing the potential impact of a change to one module on any others.

### System upgrades

These might include the need to improve the hardware used. Also, the effect of operating system changes must be tested and evaluated.

### Feature enhancements

Explain that a client might want extra features added, in addition to those originally defined. This might be especially true if the original development has been completed successfully and the client is happy with the developers’ original work.
