# Activity B - Test strategy

### Strategy

</div>

It is important that any testing that must be used is considered at the design stage as this make sure that the test strategy is comprehensive. It also allows the developer to identify any specific requirements that might be needed to complete the test processes.

### Test ownership, responsibility, and accountability.

</div>

The ownership of all test requirements must be clearly identified at the design stage so that sufficient resources can be put into place in time for the testing to be carried out.

### Test Documentation

</div>

It is important that all steps taken to test the application from planning to completion are clearly recorded and available to the development team. the client, and perhaps the end users. Modern systems of publication make this job much easier than it used to be where collaborative tools can be used to share important documentation.

### Test Plan and schedule.

<div align="left">

</div>

Create a test plan and schedule for the prototype

Columns to include:

1. **Test Case ID**: A unique identifier for each test case, facilitating easy reference and tracking.
2. **Test Description**: A brief description of what the test case is meant to verify or achieve.
3. **Preconditions**: Any specific conditions that must be met before executing the test, such as system state or configuration.
4. **Test Steps**: Detailed steps to be followed during the testing process.
5. **Expected Results**: Clearly defined outcomes that should be observed if the test passes.

### Test Log Template

</div>

the test plan is extended to include additional columns that will be populated when the application is tested.

1. **Test Case ID**: A unique identifier for each test case, facilitating easy reference and tracking.
2. **Test Description**: A brief description of what the test case is meant to verify or achieve.
3. **Preconditions**: Any specific conditions that must be met before executing the test, such as system state or configuration.
4. **Test Steps**: Detailed steps to be followed during the testing process.
5. **Expected Results**: Clearly defined outcomes that should be observed if the test passes.
6. **Actual Results**: The actual outcomes observed during test execution, to be filled in during or after testing.
7. **Status**: Indicates the result of the test, such as 'Pass', 'Fail', or 'Blocked'.
8. **Remarks/Comments**: Additional notes or comments about the test case, which may include issues encountered or reasons for failure.
9. **Tested By**: The name or identifier of the person who executed the test.
10. **Date of Execution**: The date when the test was performed.

These columns provide a structured approach to documenting and executing test cases, ensuring that each aspect of the test is clearly defined and results are accurately recorded.

### Error and defect correction strategy.

</div>

Describe why it is important that where any defects are identified during testing, a clear strategy is established for fixing them, including responsibilities and time frames.
