### Database implementation

For the prototype, the integral SQLite database provided by Django will be used. The framework provides features to allow data class models to be converted into tables in the database through migrations.

The production database could easily be converted to an enterprise model, such as SQL Server, or Azure in the cloud.

### Integrated db.sqlite3 in Django.

SQLite in Django is designed to allow software developers to create prototype databases, without complex additional software. The database instance can be managed through a ‘superuser’ / administrator account through a specific control panel feature set.

### Full CRUD

The Django framework provides access to full CRUD in the database.

Explain CRUD.
