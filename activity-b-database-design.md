The modelling of the database must be achieved into at least third normal form. You should provide a simple explanation of what that means.

The built-in database allows relational tables to be created, implementing the usual range of relationship types, such as many-to-many. The developer must be confident that they can model the scenario into a range of entities that can be converted into models in Django and then migrated into tables in the database.
