### Analyse your own current skill

Explain how you have been using Django to develop applications in the classroom and describe what sort of applications you can produce. Consider how well you can use the features of the framework and perhaps what aspects you particularly enjoy using when developing applications.

### Own development requirements

In this section acknowledge that you are not an expert user but that you are competent and can produce applications that meet the needs of the client described in the set task brief.

### Immediate requirements

For immediate development, you would describe that you need to make sure that you can use the features that you have learned effectively and produce the outcome that is required.

### Future requirements

Describe that Django development skills could be extremely useful in the workplace and that knowledge of them could improve your employment opportunities across a wide range of business types. Because of this you would hope to develop your skills beyond the use on a single desktop to make sure that you understand how deployment to an enterprise system can be achieved.

### External sources for the development of skills

To develop your skills further you would use free online resource is perhaps through YouTube or undertake formal training through a course that is run by university or complete an online learning course through Udemy or another platform.
