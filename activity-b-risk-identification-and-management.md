Consider how commercial development relies on the mitigation of risk to ensure the timely delivery of a functional project. You are providing examples of the framework that might be used to prioritise and manage any risks identified.

Identify some development threats that might result in risks, and create a risk register featuring Threat, Likelihood, Impact, and Score, Mitigation.

Example:



| Threat                                | Likelihood | Impact | Score | Mitigation                                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------ | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Availability of specialist developers | 1          | 5      | 5     | Arrange freelancer contracts early                               |
| Client changes                        | 2          | 4      | 8     | Get confirmation of design specification and acceptance criteria |
| Django Framework changes              | 1          | 1      | 2     | No mitigation required.                                          |
