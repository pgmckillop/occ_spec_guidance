# Aspect Guidance

## Icons

Icons have been used in the following sections to indicate how the tasks might be completed.

In many cases, the content can be prepared entirely in advance, as it relates to many potential scenarios, and does not depend on the particular tasks outlined in the Set Task Brief.
