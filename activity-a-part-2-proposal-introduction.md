# Activity A Part 2 Proposal Introduction

### Executive Summary

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (138).png>)

You should make use of the Set Task Brief document and summarise the initial brief scenario in your own words, picking out the nature of the client, their requirements, and a brief, non-technical, description of what you will provide.

This is the scenario already considered:

### Prototyping

Explain the nature and value of prototyping a solution before full development as a deployed application.

Think about the advantages of early feedback from the client and the end users. Consider the opportunities to save money by early agreement on design aspects, and the chance to identify errors or misunderstandings.

### The influence of good research

Expand on the earlier statements about the nature of research. Now relate it directly to software development.&#x20;

Consider the advantages that are offered by a good understanding of the activities that take place, the software and hardware, and how the future might affect the usability of the application.&#x20;

This may also relate to the maintenance needs in the future.

### Meeting the needs of the Client

This section should discuss how fulfillment of the Functional and Non-functional requirements will meet the needs of the client.

You should discuss how the client may need technical guidance to make sure that functional requirements are technically feasible.

Collaboration with the client will be needed to make sure that the target environment is matched to the requirements.

The non-functional requirements may involve aesthetic elements such as matching colour schemes, availability of logos, and so forth.

### Accessibility

Describe how the needs of any users with disabilities are considered. For example, wherever and image is included in the content of a web page, an 'alt' tag will be provided to support users with sight problems.

Investigate whether Bootstrap will be useful in this aspect.

### Meeting the needs of existing users

We use a set of analysis maps from the Design Thinking discipline to consider the needs of the user from the start of the design cycle so that we can verify and validate the development process and complete the project that fully meets the needs of the users.

Once again, the target environment and the availability of software and hardware must be closely considered.

### Meeting the needs of potential users

The developer must work with the client to secure a vision of how the client sees their market landscape as they move forward. For example, they may have plans to target different plans for platforms that can access their systems, such as a move to mobile devices.

The use of design thinking mapping will greatly aid the process of considering potential users.
