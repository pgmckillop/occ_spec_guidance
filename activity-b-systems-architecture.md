Reinforce that the prototype is required to demonstrate that the client’s functional, and non-functional, requirements are met fully. It is unlikely that a ‘first-version’ prototype will be converted exactly into the fully working, final product.

Explain how prototyping fits well with an Agile development paradigm.

Explain that the prototype allows the client, and the end-user, to validate that the functional and non-functional requirements have been met.

Also explain how their feedback on the performance of the prototype can lead to fixes, upgrades, and enhancements.

### Client-Server Architecture

The intended program will use the Django framework to produce a web application. Because of its architecture, no additional server needs to be used.

Mention that additional hardware and software would be needed if the application were to be commercially deployed.

### The client must have a web browser

The target environments will use a browser-based interface and the applications will be tested in a range of browser software versions. The proposed browser software will be Chrome-engine-based.

### Production environment

Describe that the prototype will be developed and deployed only on Microsoft Windows PCs.

The development software required will be JetBrains PyCharm.

Describe the minimum specification required to run PyCharm.

### Access to the solution

The solution will make use of the built-in web server to deploy the application to the browser on port 8000. This URL will be accessed in the browser.
