Early creation of visual interface designs allows the client and the developers to collaborate to make sure that the desired implementation is achieved. It makes early identification of misunderstandings much easier.

Initial sketches can help to clarify the ideas of both the client and the developer before much expense is introduced. A piece of paper, a pencil, and a good eraser are good investments in the design process flow to stop.

Many excellent systems for designing interfaces exist, such as Figma and Adobe XD. In using such software, very precise dimensions are defined, and some systems allow direct translation from software design into code.
