### Overview

Your application is a prototype, designed to validate that Functional and Non-functional requirements have been met.

Describe, with examples, how the prototype can be deployed to an Enterprise platform for use by many users. Consider the scenario where the users are entirely from a single organisation, and where they are accessing the application as a member of the public.

Look at the use of an integrated platform such as Heroku.

### Testing for deployment

Describe how you would arrange for the application to be tested by the client and the end-users.

Consider how the development on a standalone PC might affect this process.

### Future deployment options

How could the cloud be used to allow better access to the application?
